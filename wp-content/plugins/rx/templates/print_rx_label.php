The correction area can be for distance, intermediate such as computer work, or only for reading in the near area.<br/></br>Overnight Glassess Recommends Enhanced Accuracy Freedom HD Lenses for all Single Vision prescriptions.<br/><b>Bifocal:</b> Bifocal lenses are designed with two different viewing areas, one for distance (same as single vision), and one for reading. The reading area is designed as a D shaped magnification segment on the bottom part of the lens.<br/><b>Progressive:</b> Progressive is a multifocal lens designed without lines. It has both the advantages of the single vision aesthetics plus the multifocal magnifications. Therefore, it allows the patient to see distance, intermediate and near. To avoid peripheral distortion caused by ALL conventional progressive lenses, Overnight Glasses includes Enhanced Accuracy Freedom HD Lenses for all progressive lens orders.",
